# File-Processor-Application
A file processor application with Swing GUI, created for a SAP task, given to students at FCST of TU-Sofia - you can see the task [here](https://github.com/mtsanovv/File-Processor-Application/blob/master/sap_task.png).

## Requirements
- Java 11

## Important notes
- This app was built using OpenJDK JDK 11.0.4;
- This repository is the direct push of a IntelliJ IDEA 2020.2.3 Community Edition project, which means that there should be no problem with cloning and opening this directly as a project in the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA;
- The source files are in the `src/com/mtsanov` directory. **The runnable class when you want to build the app is FileProcessor.java**;
- There's also a compiled jar binary in the `out/artifacts/FileProcessor_jar` directory. There's also a sample file included in that directory for testing purposes;
- There's also compiled binaries for each class in `out/production/sap_task_editor/com/mtsanov` directory.

## Running the jar binary
- It's as simple as going into the `out/artifacts/FileProcessor_jar` directory and running `java -jar FileProcessor.jar`.
